## Summery
This was an analysis of a city's school districts. With interest into student math and reading scores. 
It included data about how much funding each school, and student recieved, 
as well as how many students are in each school.

## Conclusions
1. Schools over the size of 2000 studends had a significantly lower overall passing rate
2. Charter schools had a significantly higher overall passing rate
3. Interestingly the amount of money spent per student did not seem to correlate with test scores

## Code attributions/sources
